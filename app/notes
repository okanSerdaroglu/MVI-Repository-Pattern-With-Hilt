** Blog and BlogNetworkEntity should not be the same each other every time.
   We have to use a mapper for mapping API level model to project level model.

         (API level)                      (Project Level)
       BlogNetworkEntity -->   Mapper --->       Blog

** It is good practice for separating persistence models and network models.
   Because they are not always the same. Use mapper for converting them each other
